First, let's understand what the user is asking about:\nThey want to know about how our existence is connected to our forefathers' prayers.\n\n2. Looking at the passage:\n- It discusses Yehuda's approach to Yosef\n- It mentions three approaches: war (מלחמה), appeasement (פיוס), and prayer (תפלה)\n- The main discussion is about why prayer is presented as a conditional option when it should be mandatory\n\n3. Relevance analysis:\n- While the passage does discuss prayer, it's not directly addressing the merit of our forefathers' prayers\n- The passage is more focused on the technical analysis of why Yehuda presented prayer as a conditional option\n- It doesn't discuss generational merit or our existence being dependent on ancestral prayers\n- The only connection is that it involves one of our forefathers (Yehuda) and mentions prayer, but not in the context the user is asking about\n\n4. Conclusion:\nThe passage only tangentially relates to the topic. While it involves both prayer and our forefathers, it doesn't address the specific concept of our existence being dependent on their prayers.\n\nFinal Score: 3"

The passage discusses how:\n- The holy tribes (שבטים הק') prepared prayers (הכינו תפלה) for future generations\n- These prayers were meant to protect future generations in exile\n- The forefathers had divine inspiration to see future events (ראו ברוח קדשם)\n- Their actions and words created spiritual protections\n\n3. Key elements that match the question:\n- It directly mentions the protective power of the forefathers' prayers\n- It shows how their spiritual preparations continue to affect us\n- It demonstrates how their foresight helped establish protections for future generations\n\n4. However, the passage:\n- Focuses more on the forefathers' prophetic vision than their prayers specifically\n- Emphasizes the nullification of decrees (ביטול גזירות) more than general existence\n- Uses the story of Yehuda and Yosef as its primary framework\n\n5. While the passage supports the concept that our forefathers' actions protect us, it's not exclusively about their prayers sustaining our existence.\n\nFinal Score: 7\n\nThe passage gets a 7 because while it strongly supports the concept of our forefathers' spiritual actions protecting us, it's not exclusively focused on prayers or our basic existence, but rather on protection from specific decrees and dangers."

Key points from the passage:\n- It uses the metaphor of a blocked pipe that, once opened, remains open for all\n- Specifically mentions Yitzchak's prayers for children that took 20 years to be answered\n- Explains that the righteous' prayers create permanent wellsprings of salvation\n- The holy tribes' actions weren't just for themselves but for future generations\n- These channels remain open for all future generations to draw from\n\n4. The passage specifically emphasizes:\n- נשארו נצחיות לדורי דורות - remained eternal for all generations\n- פתחו מעיין ישועה לבניהם אחריהם - opened wellsprings of salvation for their children after them\n- יפתח הצינור והמעיין לכל מי שצריך - opens the channel and wellspring for all who need\n\n5.

While the passage shows a deep connection between our forefather Yaakov and us:\n- It doesn't directly address prayers\n- It focuses more on Yaakov's ongoing presence and suffering with us\n- It talks about how supporting Torah institutions helps Yaakov, rather than how his merits sustain us\n\n4. The connection points:\n- It does demonstrate the ongoing relationship between us and our forefather\n- It shows how Yaakov continues to be involved with his descendants\n- It mentions that his merit protects us (זכותו יגן עלינו) at the very end\n\n5. However:\n- The main focus is not on prayers\n- It doesn't discuss the merit of the Avos sustaining us\n- It's more about Yaakov's continued existence and connection to us\n\nFinal Score: 4\n\nThe passage has some tangential relevance to the question but doesn't directly address the role of the forefathers' prayers in sustaining our existence."
